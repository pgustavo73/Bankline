# BankLine APP

Last week we had on DIO the Santander dev week the objective was to develop 3 projects. An API of bank statements where we can consume in other 2 projects one front end project and an app. That was amazing I can go deeper in my knowledge about APIs developing that API and doing the deployment online. And today I finished finalizing another app that consumes that online API.
